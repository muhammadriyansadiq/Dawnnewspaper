      The United States announced on Friday it was
      <a href="#top" class="link"> revoking the designation</a> of Yemen’s
      Houthi rebels as a terrorist group effective February 16, a reversal by
      the Biden administration which was welcomed by the United Nations and
      humanitarian groups who feared former president Donald Trump’s actions
      would impede aid deliveries to the conflict-torn country facing the
      world’s worst humanitarian crisis
    </div>
    <div class="secondparagraph">
      US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called President Joe Biden’s decision
      to rescind the designation “a recognition of the dire humanitarian
      situation in Yemen”. He said the new US administration listened to
      warnings from the United Nations, humanitarian groups, bipartisan members
      of Congress and others “that the designations could have a devastating
      impact on Yemenis’ access to basic commodities like food and fuel”.
      <br />
      Yemen imports 90 per cent of its food, nearly all purchased through
      commercial channels, and UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock warned last
      month that the US designation of the Houthis already had companies pulling
      back from dealing with the Yemenis and would likely lead to “a large-scale
      famine on a scale that we have not seen for nearly 40 years”.
      <br />
      Blinken’s announcement followed a phone conversation on Thursday with UN
      Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, where Yemen was one of the issues they
      discussed. UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric on Friday called the US action
      “extremely positive”. “We hope that helps build momentum for a political
      solution to the conflict in Yemen,” Dujarric said. “I think the reversal
      of the designation, the naming of the [US] special envoy [for Yemen], and
      the clear, clear language from the top of the administration, from
      president Biden himself, expressing his strong support for the UN-led
      mediation process [...] are very, very welcome indeed.”
      <br />
      In 2014, the rebel Houthis overran the capital, Sanaa, and much of Yemen’s
      north, driving the government into exile. A US-backed, Saudi-led coalition
      intervened the following year to try and restore the internationally
      recognised government, but years of UN efforts to get both sides to agree
      to a ceasefire and start peace negotiations have not succeeded. The
      conflict has been disastrous for Yemen, the Arab world’s poorest country,
      killing more than 112,000 people, creating a humanitarian disaster, and
      wrecking infrastructure from roads and hospitals to water and electricity
      networks.
      <br />
      The State Department confirmed last week that Biden was moving to revoke
      the designation, a day after the president announced an end to offensive
      support to Saudi Arabia’s campaign against the Houthis.
